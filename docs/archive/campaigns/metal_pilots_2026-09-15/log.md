**Authorized RING continuation completed (2026-09-15):** all four smokes
and sixteen full 50-epoch fits in the
[bounded matched comparison](docs/METAL_TRAINING_PIPELINE_PLAYBOOK.md#bounded-matched-ring-continuation--stage-2b)
are verified locally and in Drive. Both complete family blocks passed their
budget gates. Terminal checkpoint/configuration/normalization binding passed;
the owned G4 session `deepmzyme-metal-ring-20260915` stopped at
**16:20:52.944619 UTC**, and Colab reported no active sessions.
The original cumulative allocation is **7.312911 hours**, leaving
**2.687089 hours of the original ten-hour cap**. The two prior closed
allocations remain unchanged; the budget was not reset.

Only-GVP's mean RING-on-minus-off BA differences are **+1.426 pp** at
`3e-5` and **+0.387 pp** at `1e-4`; all four LR/seed differences are positive,
but mean Class VIII recall falls by **3.125 / 4.688 pp** respectively.
All four graph-level late-fusion pairs have identical selected BA and class
recalls, not proven identical models or predictions. This is **Grade 3** on
one shared validation split and two training seeds, with no promotion.
The audit found annotations on existing edges, no topology expansion and
matching normalization within all trained pairs. The existing local CPU
audit was not restarted; frozen source, previous pilots and Phase-3 analysis
were preserved. No held-out evaluation or auxiliary training was added.

**Authorized metal pilots completed (2026-09-15):** all 30 original architecture
fits and 15 geometry fits, each 50 epochs, plus 12 model smokes are verified
locally and in Drive. Both queues passed genuine terminal-state verification;
all 15 geometry prediction exports are verified. The owned G4 session
`deepmzyme-metal-geometry-20260915` stopped at **11:37:34.517659 UTC**, and
the server reported no active sessions. Total allocation across both sessions
was **5.350957 hours of the original ten-hour cap**, including recovery,
setup, transfer and analysis.

In the original architecture pilot, selected-LR direct-four means ± sample SD
across training seeds 42/43 are
Only-ESM **74.342 ± 3.138%**, late fusion **72.437 ± 0.177%**, Only-GVP
**72.073 ± 1.663%**, and early fusion **65.926 ± 4.866%**. These are Grade-3
results on the same validation data, with no promotion. Late-five's
common-four mean is **74.718 ± 2.486%**, an exploratory target challenger
with class tradeoffs; native and common-four results come from each
native-selected checkpoint. See the [completed continuation report](docs/notebook_outputs/summaries/summary_metal_architecture_pilot_continuation_20260915.md)
and [verified stop receipt](docs/notebook_outputs/raw/metal_architecture_pilot_20260915/continuation/closeout_allocation2/post_stop/session_stopped.json).

All geometry arms selected LR `1e-4`; increasing LR improved seed-42 BA by
7.6–10.4 percentage points. Selected-LR means across training seeds 42/43 are
A 69.641%, B 70.186%, C 70.007%, D 68.865%, and E 68.030%. B−A and C−B
advantages reverse between seeds; D−B and E−D are negative in both high-LR
seeds. This is Grade-3 repetition on the **same validation data**, with no
architecture promotion or universal rejection. E's worst Zn recall is
15.625% (5/32), illustrating the class tradeoffs hidden by aggregate BA.
The fresh A control masks only the added coordination-count/angle slots: it
retains the original GVP geometry and four base metal-site statistics
(multinuclear flag, metal count, minimum/mean intermetal distances). Its
matched explicit machinery differs from the original legacy GVP baseline.
See the [completed geometry summary](docs/notebook_outputs/summaries/summary_metal_coordination_geometry_pilot_20260915.md)
and its verified prediction/paired-error evidence.

Fitted-normalization hashes match within A/B/C and within D/E, as required.
Adding metal nodes changes representation, connectivity and fitted edge
normalization together; those contrasts do not isolate topology alone.

Recovery verified the original frozen source and manifest, all 1,389 retained
pockets (1,181 train / 208 validation), unchanged feature contents and fresh
cache timestamps. Seven original smokes and all eight A1/A2 results are now
verified, including completed late-fusion linked retry `attempt_013`.
The original interrupted `attempt_012` is reconciled as incomplete; its exact
attempt duration is unknown and was not invented. The full first allocation
of 3,827.969 seconds remains charged to the shared 600-minute cap, together
with the second allocation and recovery. The prior two-allocation closed
total was 19,263.446 seconds, leaving 16,736.554 seconds before the RING
continuation; the current three-allocation total is reported above.
The geometry implementation and recovery controls passed 134 focused tests
in 30.37 seconds; 11 separate owned-teardown tests also passed. Legacy model
outputs remain bitwise unchanged in the checked compatibility comparison.
These are implementation/readiness checks, not geometry-model results.
The largest A1/A2 balanced accuracies are late fusion **0.723121** and
Only-ESM **0.721228**, a gap of only **0.001893**. These are experimentally
evaluated single-seed results, with no established architecture winner or
promotion. Hybrid is **deferred under the budget scheduling gate**, not
rejected: best early fusion did not exceed best Only-GVP by the required
margin. The bounded target/seed matrix is complete; full hybrid comparison
and grouped-fold/paired-CI confirmation, including RING, remain absent.
The separately completed bounded RING pilot does not fill those gates.
No held-out evaluation occurred;
historical multi-seed anchors remain separately labeled.
See the [first-allocation summary](docs/notebook_outputs/summaries/summary_metal_architecture_pilot_20260915.md)
and [geometry recipe](docs/METAL_TRAINING_PIPELINE_PLAYBOOK.md#bounded-coordination-geometry-pilot--stage-2b).
