## v3-005

2026-10-04 — plan step A1 complete: the v3 fold set `v3-seqid90-s42-b2` is
frozen under `/media/mechti/Data1/DeepMzyme_Data/campaigns/pmm_ion_metal_v3/folds/`
(`fold_membership.csv` SHA-256 `e6b21364159da479dc3fb325a01ede36c62489184a77d858f71fefe6c401da7a`;
receipt `fold_receipt.json` with input, output and code identities; builder
`v3-near-copy-folds-2` at commit `3102c2a`, seed 42, 200 starts). Only training
inputs were read, under the read guard; every one of the 7,664 context-chain
sequences matched its frozen ESMC hash.

Result: 7,398 ions, 3,992 PDB entries, 4,972 unique chains, 11,609 near-copy
pairs, 2,208 groups. All acceptance checks pass (48 of 200 starts; start 198):
fold ions 1,471–1,500 (target 1,479.6); Cu 67–73 ions from 24–25 groups per
fold; at least 24 groups of every element in every fold. No near-copy under
the builder's rule crosses folds (the v2 folds had 50.9% of ions with a
cross-fold near-copy).

Refinement of the A1 near-copy rule: identity divides by the shorter chain's
length plus its number of internal insertion events, so the 5-mer prefilter is
provably lossless. A first build (`v3-seqid90-s42`, builder version 1) counted
every inserted residue instead; independent verification showed it split 25
plan-rule near-copy pairs (54 ions) across folds, so it is marked superseded and
must not be used. Under the plan's original wording, 9 borderline pairs
(identity 90.0–90.6% of the shorter chain) still cross the frozen folds.

Verification (read-only, independent methods): exhaustive screening of all
11.9 million chain pairs with a different lossless filter found no qualifying
pair the builder missed; 50,000+ skipped pairs aligned exactly stayed below 90%;
balance recomputed exactly; byte-identical rebuilds under different Python hash
seeds. Known limits: chains below 90% identity can cross folds (about 11% of
ions have an 80–90% cross-fold partner), so this is near-copy, not homology,
separation; and a few large families dominate one element in one fold (largest
single-group shares: Ni 0.51 and Cu 0.43 in fold 4, Mn 0.40 in fold 1).

## v3-004

2026-10-04 — an external review of the v3 plan (Codex, read-only) raised twelve
points; each was checked against the repository by five read-only verifiers
(no test files, no compute). All were accepted. Two were accepted only in part:
policy does not require two confirmation seeds, and the step-D parameter values
are a user choice rather than a wording fix. Minor inaccuracies (misplaced line
references, a non-binding source cited as binding) did not change any verdict.
The verifiers also found that the trainer cannot yet consume group-based v3
folds, that a locally built graph cache does not match the VM's torch build,
that augmented fits rebuild every training graph each epoch, and that no RING
files exist for the v3 cohort. The [plan](plan.md) was revised accordingly and
then checked once more for consistency; that check moved the A4 freeze before
any GPU run, made every budget stop a user choice, and moved Round C out of the
plan's code and budget pending a separate decision after Round B.

User decisions:

- Step E: the neutral four-versus-five/six test uses the step C baseline recipe,
  frozen before step D, on all five folds; improvements are confirmed separately
  in `four_class` on folds 1–4 against that baseline.
- Decision statistics: bootstrap and t intervals must agree; a target tie keeps
  `four_class`; a zero native recall blocks a five/six "better" call.
- Step D gate: both seeds must improve, in addition to the 1.5-point mean and the
  3-point class guard.
- The final-test label is decided before step E, after the user checks the
  2026-09-24 Zenodo run.

Defaults set by Claude under the user's instruction to accept or reject the
review's points (changeable by a dated entry before the affected step): seed 42
only in step E; step-D values (modality dropout 0.2, outer-residue dropout 0.1,
coordinate noise 0.1 Å, label smoothing 0.1, `counts_angles` against `none`);
the step-B adoption thresholds; the 3.0-point regression band; the fold
acceptance limits; the cost gate for augmentation; and the Stage 6 selection
rule (Only-ESMC baseline `four_class` control, 0.2-point tie band,
tie-breakers), which is shown to the user with the A4 specification before it
is frozen.

STATUS text replaced by this update, preserved verbatim:

```text
- Stage: v3 design; no folds, runs, Stage 6 confirmation, Stage 6B refit or Stage 7.
Next: user decisions on the v3 design listed in its README, starting with the
final metal test route. Stage 6 grouped-fold selection (or an explicitly labeled
fallback), a completed Stage 6B full non-test refit, frozen report/checkpoint
rules and a scientifically resolved final-test route must precede one-shot
Stage 7. No test-based tuning, ranking, promotion, rejection or checkpoint
choice; see [Plan](Plan.md#canonical-staged-metal-training-pipeline).
```

## v3-003

2026-10-04 — the user confirmed active Google Cloud free-trial credits on the
billing account (upgraded free trial; about ₪848 remaining, expiring
2026-12-24; Google reports they cover all eligible usage). Under the user's
rule from [v3-002](#v3-002), the v3 GPU budget ceiling is **$40 gross** for
steps B–F. Costs stay tracked at gross list price; credits never widen the
controller's session and daily caps or any limit, and usage is not described
as free. Every GPU start still needs the user's explicit OK.

STATUS line replaced by this update, preserved verbatim:

```text
- Authorized now: v3 CPU preparation only ([plan](docs/campaigns/pmm_ion_metal_v3/plan.md)); every GPU start needs the user's explicit OK within the [recorded ceiling](docs/campaigns/pmm_ion_metal_v3/log.md#v3-002); no refit or held-out evaluation.
```

## v3-002

2026-10-04 — user decisions after discussion:

- The [v3 plan](plan.md) (steps A–F) is approved.
- The 2026-09-28 rule "no file added or changed in `src/` or `scripts/`" is
  lifted for v3 work: changes use off-by-default options with tests. The frozen
  `_code/pmm_core_scope_v2` checkout stays untouched.
- Checkpoint rule: cosine learning-rate schedule to zero and the terminal
  checkpoint for every v3 arm, fold and refit (Plan updated the same day).
- PMM: compare with published PinMyMetal numbers only; no PMM retraining.
- Folds: chains at ≥90% identity grouped together, random group order, metals
  balanced. Improvement screening on one new fold with two seeds is accepted.
- GPU budget: $15 gross until the user confirms that free credits cover Compute
  Engine, then $40. No GPU start is authorized without the user's explicit OK.

STATUS lines replaced by this update, preserved verbatim:

```text
- Status: planned (2026-10-03 PMM core v2 closed at fold 0; v3 planning only)
- Last execution evidence: 2026-09-28. Documentation reconciliation: 2026-10-03 (closure and verified findings).
- Authorized now: nothing (no experiment, GPU work, final refit or held-out evaluation).
```

## v3-001

2026-10-03 — campaign opened in planning status. The user chose separate
`four_class`, `five_class` and `six_class` arms for Only-ESMC, Only-GVP and
graph-level late fusion. Predecessor:
[closed PMM campaign](../../archive/campaigns/pmm_ion_metal/README.md).
